# didichroniclesfiles
These are the files and folders I use to host my <a href="https://chroniclesofdidi.com">podcast.</a> 

The page <a href="https://chroniclesofdidi.com/jsrenderxml.html"> jsrender.html</a> will generate an xml code block for a podcast episode which you can then paste into your RSS feed.

Prior to developing this page using JavaScript I was using a google forms based method to generate the code.  (See my repository xml generator.)
