# didichroniclesfiles
Using this to track select files from main directory of chronicles of didi (feed.xml)
These are the files and folders I use to host my podcast.

The page jsrenderxml.html will generate an xml code block for a podcast episode which you can then paste into your RSS feed.
Prior to developing this page using JavaScript I was using a google forms based method to generate the code.  (See my repository xml generator.)
